# PCOS Data Analysis in R
Beginner-friendly end-to-end analysis of a PCOS clinical dataset, focusing on clean data handling, EDA, and clear visuals.

Highlights
Cleaned and prepared data: handled missing values, fixed types (e.g., BMI → numeric), and created factors for plotting.

Explored key variables: Age, BMI, AMH, LH/FSH ratio, insulin; compared PCOS vs Non‑PCOS groups.

Visualized distributions and relationships: histograms, boxplots (e.g., BMI by PCOS status), scatterplots, and a correlation heatmap using ggplot2.

Reproducible workflow with organized scripts and an R Markdown report for analyses and plots.

Tech Stack
R, tidyverse (dplyr, tidyr, readr), ggplot2

What I Learned
Practical data cleaning, EDA best practices, and plotting; set up a modular, reproducible workflow suitable for extension.

Next Steps
Add classification models (logistic regression, random forest), interpretability (feature importance/SHAP), and an interactive Shiny dashboard.

How to Run
Install packages: tidyverse, ggplot2

Execute scripts in order: data_cleaning.R → eda.R → visuals.R
OR knit the R Markdown report to generate the full analysis.
